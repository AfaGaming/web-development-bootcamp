# Section 20 - APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

**About:** This section is all about using Servers and APIs to create a web application.

**Part A:** A weather application.

**Part B:** An e-mail sign up web application. This allows me to collect real user's email addresses and save it to my own database on MailChimp so, I can contact them at later point. This is a very useful web application if I have a landing page for a product and would like to contact people for marketing purposes.
## Lessons Learned
- API: An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.
- API: Endpoint, Paths, Parameters, Authentication
- Open Weather Map API
- Postman
- JSON (Javascript Object Notation)
- Making GET Requests with the Node HTTPS Module
- Native Node HTTPS Module
- Parsing JSON and strigify()
- Note: You can only have one res.send() in any given one of the app methods. It is kind of the like return statement of a function. If you try to res.send() more than once, you will end up getting an error.
- Using Express to Render a Website with Live API Data
- res.write()
- Using body parser to parse POST requests to the Server
- express.static()
- Posting Data to Mailchimp's Servers via thier API
- Redirecting web-pages
- Deploying server using Heroku
