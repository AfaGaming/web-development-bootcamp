# Section 23 - Daily Journal/Blog Website

**About:** In the last few sections, I've covered a lot of important concepts, and in this section, I am going to put them to use by building a blog/journal website. It is a very minimalistic website with a header, a nav bar, brand, a sticky footer. The header and footer are generated using EJS partials. On the home page, there will be all of the blog posts listed in chronological order and the blog content is truncated to 100 characters. When you click on read more button, it will take you to an individual page of each of the blog posts and you can read them independently on a single page. There is also a hidden page which allows me to compose a post.
