# Section 15 - The Simon Game

**About:** In this section, I built a game that is modeled off the game [Simon](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ttZ3so6EL._SL1000_.jpg). The way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on, and as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated. At some point you are going to mess up and it is going to tell you that you've got it wrong, and game is over, so, you can press any key to restart the game. 

**e.g.** The game shows the first colour in the sequence (blue). The user clicks on the blue button. Next, the game shows the next colour (red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.
If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.
## Lessons Learned
