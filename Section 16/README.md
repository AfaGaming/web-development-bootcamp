# Section 16 - The Unix Command Line

**About:** In this section, I learned about Command Lines, Git Bash, Hyper Terminal and more. Going over some of the most used and basic commands of using terminal.
## Lessons Learned
- Installing Git and Git Bash
- Installing Hyper Terminal
- Bash - Bourne Again Shell
- Directory Navigation
    - ls - list (lists all the items in a particular directory)
    - cd 'filename' or 'filepath' - changes directory into one of the folders in current directory
        - Note: use tab to complete the name 
    - cd ~ - This will take you back to root directory
        - Note: use up and down arrow keys to use previous commands typed in, if you don't want to re-type them; you can go through your entire history of previous commands using these keys
    - cd .. - this takes you one step back to the parent directory of the current directory
    - if you want to move to a directory that is not a folder in your current directory, either type out the entire path after cd to get there, or you can go to root directory and navigate to it or use cd .. to go up a directory and navigate that way.
    - use alt key and press anywhere, where you are typing to get your cursor there in order to edit if you have made a typo
    - ctrl + A - takes your cursor right at the begining of the line you are typing
    - ctrl + E - takes your cursor to very end of the line you are typing
    - ctrl + U - If you have typed a command and don't want to execute it, use ctrl + U to erase the entire command
- Creating, Opening, and Removing Files using Command Line
    - mkdir 'directoryname' - creates a new directory of the directory name provided
    - touch 'filename.etension' - creates a new file of the name and extension provided in the current directory
    - MacOS: open 'filename.extension' / Windows: start 'filename.extension' - this opens the file specified in the default application selected
    - MacOS: open -a 'application name' 'file.extension' / Windows: start -a 'application name' 'file.extension' - this allows you to open the file in the application you provide instead of default app.
    - rm * - this command deletes all the files in the current Directory
    - rm 'filename' - this command particularly deletes the filename provided in the current directory
        - Note: rm only removes files, not directories.
    - pwd - print working directory (pwd), this command prints the path of the directory you are currently in
    - rm -r 'directory name'/ - this allows you to delete the directory present in the current Directory
