**About:** In this section, I was introduced to databasesd and how to persist user data.
## Lesson Learned
- SQL vs NoSQL
- SQL - Structured Query Language
- NoSQL - Not Only Structured Language
- A SQL database will group your data into tables
- In NoSQL, data is represented as JSON Objects
- Relational vs Non-Relational
- NoSQL is more flexible in terms of storing data than SQL
- NoSQL might have a lot of repition in its data but, in SQL, if you create multiple tables and connect them appropriately, you can avoid repitition
- NoSQL has more scalability in comparison to SQL
