# Section 12 - The Dicee Game

**About:**  Applying all the concepts learned of Javascript ES6 and DOM (along with HTML and CSS) into a website and creating a game called dicee. There are two dices and everytime the website is refreshed, the dices are rolled and the player with larger number is the winner.

Along with the Dicee game, I created a Crystal Ball webpage which draws inspiration from the magic 8 ball. Everytime you ask a question and refresh the page, the crystal ball will give you an answer. (Note: This is not a real crystal ball, it is only made for me to learn to concepts and for fun.)
