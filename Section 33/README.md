# Section 33 - React.js

**About:** React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. It is a front-end framework. The idea is to make it easier and faster to build beautiful user interfaces such as the ones on Airbnb. One of the best things about React is it makes is easy to create repetitive elements. Effectively, you end up breaking down a complex user interface structure into a component tree. React also vastly simplifies the structure of website. It is kind of like we're creating our own custom HTML element defining the styling and defining the functionality of each of them. Then, we can slot them in, like HTML elements, inside an overall structure keeping the code for our web app incredibly clean, reusable, and modular. These are all great things for programming clean code and creating apps that scale well even when it gets big and complex. You can think of these components as different ingredients that go into a burger, and depending on what it is you need, you can chop and change these components and customize these components. This is achieved partly through mixing of the different types of files. Previously, we tried to keep HTML, CSS, and JS files seperate but, what React does and what it benefits from is actually combining small amounts of each of these files into a single component so that each component has its own styling, its own functionality that it controls, and you can create several of these components to each perform a different function and have a different appearance. Another awsome thing that React does is, it is able to re-render these changes efficiently, and it does this by comparing changes, so, what we might call diffing. Whenever a change happens, say a new piece of data comes in or the user does something, then it is going compare the new version of the DOM tree that you want to be rendered with the old version that's already showing up and it will do this kind of spot-the-difference thing where it spots the only thing that has changed and it will only re-render that particular component. This makes web app more efficient, more interactive, and faster.
## Projects

- Registration Screen
- Real time clock app
- Emojipedia - A Emoji Dictionary
- To Do List App
- **Final Project:** The big project that I worked on is Keeper which is clone of Google Keep. So, whenever you have any new ideas, you can simply take a note and add it to your own Keeper App.
