# Section 06 - Introduction to Bootstrap

**About Project A:** You've heard of Tinder but, have you heard of TinDog? That is the question I answer in this project. In this project, I used Bootstrap and more advanced CSS to create this beautiful start up landing page. It has a title section, a features section, a carousel to browse testimonials, a pricing plan section, and a call to action where users are encouraged to download the application, and finally a nice little footer with socials on it. While building it I learned a lot of cool features that Boostrap offers and some more advanced CSS along the way.

**About Project B:** Have you ever stayed away from home and got tired of eating at restaurants and take outs? Did you miss home-made food? That is the question I answer in this project. YumYum is a start up idea for people who cook at home and want to make a living. They would love to have a restaurant but, they can't afford to have one, that is where YumYum comes to the rescue, lovingly prepared homecooked meals by our clients for our customers. This project's landing-page also has all the features that tindog possess all the while ensuring all the Boostrap lessons learned are well set in my brain.
