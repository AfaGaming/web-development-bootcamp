# Section 13 - Advanced Javascript ES6 and DOM Manipulation

**About:** In this section, while learning some of the more intermediate/advanced parts of the Document Object Model, I built a drum kit and a xylophone keys website. By the end of this section, I learned and understood how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes and how to respond to them. I've got a number of keys on either websites that represent different drums/different xylophone keys in a typical drum set/xylophone, and when I click on any of these buttons then I get the corresponding sound. In addition, I can also use the keys on the keyboard to play the sound.
## Lessons Learned

- Event Listener: addEventListener()
- Anonymous Function
- Higher order Functions and Passing Functions as Arguments
- HTML Audio Element
- HTML Media Element
- JS 'this' keyword
- Objects: creating objects, contructor function, initializing objects, Methods
- JS 'new' keyword
- JS Switch Statements
- JS Fuctions vs Methods (Note: Methods are functions that are associated to an object. Not all Functions are Methods.)
- JS 'keydown' Event Listener
- JS Callback Functions and How to respond to events
- Adding Animations to Websites
