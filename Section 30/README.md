# Section 30 - Daily Journal/Blog Website Upgrade

**About:** In this section, I further developed the blog website from section 23. I added a MongoDB database to it in order to persist its posts.
## Lesson Learned
- Setting up Blog Databases using MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Saving Composed Posts to the Database
- Getting the Home Page to render the posts stored in the Database
- Rendering the correct blog post based on post_id
