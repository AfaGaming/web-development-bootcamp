# Section 19 - Express.js 

**About:** Introduction to Express.js. Learning all about a framework for Node.js which is basically a bunch of code that somebody else wrote, that adds extra features and helps to organize and structure code, specifically for web applications built with Node. In this section, I built a real server using Node and Express to see how I could get the server to start running code on the server side in order to learn how to build a proper backend for websites.

**Project:** In this section, I built a calculator using Command Line, Node.js, and Express.js to build a web application website.
## Lessons Learned
- npm install express - Instal Express.js
- Listening to a Port
- Requests & Response to provide when browser makes get request
- Nodemon Installation - Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in the source and automatically restart the server. This will save you from constantly have to use ctrl + c to stop the server and restart it.
- Sending files as response when get request is made
- __dirname
- Processing Post Requests with Body Parser
- bodyparser.urlencoded
